### Executing program
To run the program, you need to deploy the SimpleBank contract on a blockchain network. You can use Remix IDE or any other Ethereum development environment for deployment.

1.Deployment Steps (using Remix IDE):
2.Open Remix IDE.
3.Create a new file and paste the content of the SimpleBank contract.
4.Compile the contract.
5.Deploy the contract to a blockchain network (e.g., JavaScript VM, Rinkeby, etc.).
